# Stability Testing
---
In order to ensure that machines in the performance pool are providing data that we can trust over time we need a metric that does not change with the project.  So we have decided to use a simple native benchmark that we can run once a day and track over time.  This will allow us to understand any drift that is happening in our physical hardware and respond to it.
